- I‚Äôm a passionate engineer in Statistics and Data Analysis, graduated from [ESSAI](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/en/) and holding a research master‚Äôs degree in Data processing and Complexity of Living Systems from [ENIT](http://www.enit.rnu.tn/fr/home/indexfr.php) and Paris Descartes university.

- Throughout my professional experiences, I have gained proficiency in a variety of analytical tools, including R, Python, SQL, Alteryx, and Power BI. I‚Äôm also certified as a Carpentries instructor.

- I began my career as a Data Scientist in the banking sector before moving to Paris.

- In my current role as a Data Consultant at the French consulting company ArData, I specialize in using the R programming language. I'm involved in the creation of interactive data-driven web applications using Shiny, implementing effective data visualization practices, automating analytical processes, and providing training in R.

- I was pleased to have been awarded the Opportunity 2023 Scholarship from Posit.

- I was also extremely happy to be selected as a [Diversity Scholar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KanOLRXW7GIuVtXTZMp3U_U1TLRJAAZ0/view?usp=sharing) in conjunction with the [rstudio::global virtual conference](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/30/diversity-scholarships/) in January 2021. This valuable scholarship gives me opportunities for online networking and support before and during the virtual conference.

- I use many programming languages and softwares for building data solutions. I love programming, but I also love to organize communities within them effective knowledge sharing happens. That‚Äôs why I decided to combine these two, by co-foundering of two communities: [Tunis R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/tunis-r-user-group) and [PyLadies Tunis](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/). I'm also lead of [R-Lades Paris](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/) community and member of the [ArabR](https://arabr.github.io/) committee.

- I‚Äôm also delighted to be part of the [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/) Team as being responsible for the Onboarding Process. I love participating in widening the R-Ladies communities worldwide. As it was said: ‚ÄúThose who are happiest are those who do the most for others.‚Äù - Booker T. Washington

- I‚Äôm so happy for being part of these great communities. These experiences are helping me to expand my network, meet amazing people worldwide, get inspired by them, and improving my R and Python skills.
