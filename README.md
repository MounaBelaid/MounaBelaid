- I‚Äôm a passionate engineer in Statistics and Data Analysis, graduated from [ESSAI](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/en/) and holding a research master‚Äôs degree in Data processing and Complexity of Living Systems from [ENIT](http://www.enit.rnu.tn/fr/home/indexfr.php) and [Paris Descartes university](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHODY2FBoI9ZLopNlO3KEz4qOHhW73EO/view?usp=sharing).

- I was working as a Data Scientist in the Banking industry specialized in Credit Risk management. I‚Äôm experienced in using data science tools like R, Python and SQL to build data solutions.

- Currently, I‚Äôm encountering a set of responsibilities as a Business Intelligence Consultant at [Prime Analytics](https://www.primeanalytics.fr/) based in Paris, France. My role consists of proposing data solutions and strategies to business challenges after understanding customer requirements. I‚Äôm using technologies like Power BI, Tableau and Alteryx in order to make smart informed decisions. I‚Äôm delighted of being part of an international company that is allowing me to expand my work on an international scale and get larger responsibilities abroad.

- I was also extremely happy to be selected as a [Diversity Scholar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KanOLRXW7GIuVtXTZMp3U_U1TLRJAAZ0/view?usp=sharing) in conjunction with the [rstudio::global virtual conference](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/30/diversity-scholarships/) in January 2021. This valuable scholarship gives me opportunities for online networking and support before and during the virtual conference.

- I use many programming languages and softwares for building data solutions. I love programming, but I also love to organize communities within them effective knowledge sharing happens. That‚Äôs why I decided to combine these two, by co-foundering of two communities: [Tunis R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/tunis-r-user-group) and [PyLadies Tunis](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-tunis/). I'm also lead of R-Lades Paris community and member of the [ArabR](https://arabr.github.io/) committee.

- I‚Äôm also delighted to be part of the [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/about-us/team/) Team as being responsible for the Onboarding Process. I love participating in widening the R-Ladies communities worldwide. As it was said: ‚ÄúThose who are happiest are those who do the most for others.‚Äù - Booker T. Washington

- I‚Äôm so happy for being part of these great communities. These experiences are helping me to expand my network, meet amazing people worldwide, get inspired by them, and improving my R and Python skills.
